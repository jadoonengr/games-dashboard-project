# Motivation and Purpose 

**Our role:**   
**Target audience:** 

 The video game industry is a very competitive and profitable industry. In 2019, video game revenue was a reported $150.2 billion and is estimated to increase to $179.7 billion in 2020. There are many factors that affect the success of a game, many of which depend and are influenced by what goes on in the development phase. While the content of the game itself is vital to the success of the game, things such as choosing the right platform of release, which regions to make it accessible to and what genre of game to make are also essential to the success of your game. This is increasingly important for small developers with limited resources and even other related industries like streaming or ESports. Knowing which areas of the gaming industry are saturated, popular or becoming popular will put you in a much better position for success.

With this app users will be able to visualize trends in popularity in genres and platforms across various regions in the world. (IDK THIS REALLY DEPENDS WHAT WE WANT TO SHOW)

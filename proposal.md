# Motivation and Purpose 

**Our role:**   
**Target audience:** 

 The video game industry is a very competitive and profitable industry. In 2019, video game revenue was reported to be $150.2 billion, and is estimated to increase to $179.7 billion in 2020. There are many factors that obviously affect the success of a game, many of which depend on the talent and skill on the development team. While the content of the game itself is obviously vital to the success of the game, there can also be other ways to help your game succeed. Things like choosing the right platform to release your game, which regions to make it accessible to, what genre of game you would like to make are also essential to the success of your game. Especially for small developers with limited resources and even other related industries like streaming or ESports, knowing which areas of the gaming industry are saturated, popular or becoming popular will put you in a much better position for success.

With this app users will be able to visualize trends in popularity in genres and platforms across various regions in the world. (IDK THIS REALLY DEPENDS WHAT WE WANT TO SHOW)

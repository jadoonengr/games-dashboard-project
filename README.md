This dashboard presents the composition of historical videogame sales from 1980 to 2020, according to their genre (Roleplaying, Strategy, Action, etc.), console (PlayStation, Xbox, PC, etc.) and region (Europe, Asia, North America, etc.). It includes bar charts, scatter plots and violing plots which are all color coded to better convey their message and compare to each other. They are all adjustable to the preferred point of view of the user, including a slider to adjust the visualized date range and dropdown lists to allow the user to filter for the region, platform and genre of interest. (i.e. Nintendo sales between 1990 and 2000 for action games) A list shows the top seller titles for the selected filters, with a summary of their information, and a selector allows the user to show more or less titles on this table.

The app contains a landing page that shows the distribution (depending on data type, bar chart, density chart etc) of dataset factors (hypertension, physical disabilities etc.) colored coded according to whether patients showed up or didnâ€™t show up for an appointment. From a dropdown list, users can filter out variables from the distribution display, by patient demographics (i.e. only show female patients), by appointment data (i.e. if SMS was sent), and finally by the date range of appointments. A different dropdown menu will allow users to re-order variables according to the probability of patients being a no-show or in alphabetical order to comorbidities. Users can compare the distribution of co-morbidities by scrolling down through the app interface.
